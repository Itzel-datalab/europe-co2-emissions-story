# 🌍 Europe CO₂ Emissions Storytelling

**Data Storytelling & Visual Analysis Project**  
A data-driven exploration of per capita CO₂ emissions across selected European countries.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project examines the historical trends of per capita CO₂ emissions across European nations, highlighting the evolution of climate performance and disparities between countries.

By leveraging public emissions datasets and visual storytelling techniques, the analysis offers:

- Insights into equity and responsibility in climate action  
- A time-series comparison between Germany, Czechia, Belgium, and the Netherlands  
- Professional-quality data visualization implemented in Python

 Key Visualizations
Per Capita Emissions - Top 10 Countries
This chart highlights the countries with the highest per capita CO₂ emissions in Europe, illustrating disparities in individual carbon footprints.


Production vs Consumption Emissions
A comparative analysis between emissions produced within a country and those embodied in the consumption of imported goods, showcasing the carbon footprint beyond borders.


CO₂ Emissions - Top 10 Countries Over Time
This time series visualization tracks the evolution of total CO₂ emissions for the top emitting European countries, revealing trends and progress over the years.


📈 Key Findings
Czechia has consistently ranked highest in per capita CO₂ emissions among the selected countries until recent years, when Belgium and Germany have closely followed.

Germany’s emissions showed a declining trend after 1990, reflecting policy impacts and industrial changes.

The distinction between production and consumption emissions highlights the importance of considering imported goods in assessing a country’s carbon footprint.

Overall, there are clear disparities in emissions intensity, pointing towards equity challenges in climate responsibility.

🚀 Future Work
Extend the analysis to include more European countries and recent years.

Incorporate additional greenhouse gases and land use change impacts.

Develop interactive dashboards for enhanced data exploration.

Explore machine learning models to forecast future emissions trends.
